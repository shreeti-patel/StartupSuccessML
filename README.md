# Project README

## Overview

This project is divided into two main parts: **Part 1 Crunchbase Data** and **Part 2 PrivCo Data**. Each part focuses on data analysis and model training using separate datasets. Both parts are organized as follows:

- **Part 1 Crunchbase Data:** Analysis and modeling on Crunchbase data.
- **Part 2 PrivCo Data:** Analysis and modeling on PrivCo data.

Each folder contains specific files that must be executed in a particular order to ensure the proper workflow.

### Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure that you have a Python environment with all necessary packages (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost) installed. These can also be installed in the beginning of each jupyter notebook file. 

## Part 1: Crunchbase Data

### Code Execution Order:
1. `startingEDA_CB.ipynb`
2. `ModelTraining_CB.ipynb`

### Files:

- `2014-crunchbase-data`  
  Contains raw Crunchbase data for 2014.

- `2015-crunchbase-data`  
  Contains raw Crunchbase data for 2015.

- `Cleaned_startup_data.pkl`  
  A serialized output in PKL format, generated by `startingEDA_CB.ipynb`.

- `KaggleDataset`  
  A directory containing additional datasets from Kaggle.

- `startingEDA_CB.ipynb`  
  An exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebook that processes raw Crunchbase data to produce `Cleaned_startup_data.pkl`.

- `ModelTraining_CB.ipynb`  
  A notebook that uses `Cleaned_startup_data.pkl` to train machine learning models.

## Part 2: PrivCo Data

### Part 2 will be uploaded soon.
